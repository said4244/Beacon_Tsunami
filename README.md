# Beacon_Tsunami
beacon_tsunami.py is a program that makes and sends beacon frames. Firstly it'll ask for how many fake access points you want, and then it'll ask for a name for each AP. After that it'll start making sending out the beacon frames. This program was only tested on Linux. Before starting the program your machine needs to be in monitor mode + you need to be using a network card that is capable of sending/injecting frames (I used the Alfa AWUS036NH Long-Range)
